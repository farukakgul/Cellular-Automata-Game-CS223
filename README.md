# CellularCollegeIDgame

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

Game consist of regular grid of cells. Each cell is in on or off state determined according to the neighboring cells. We will use horizontal and vertical neighbors of the cell to determine the next state of the cell (North, South, East and West).

I used SystemVerilog Hardware Decsription Language to implement the game. Basys3 FPGA Board and BetiBoard( 8 * 8 leds) are the components of my project.
